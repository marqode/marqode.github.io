      <p>
        Thanks for visiting my site! I am a full stack developer and mechanical
        engineer, outdoor adventurer and node in the human network. I created
        this space to house my portfolio and some fun projects. When {"I'm"} not
        developing tech I love being outside and playing music. Feel free to
        reach out if {" you'd"} like to collaborate on a project!
      </p>
